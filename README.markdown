# My dotfiles, versioned

Mostly just prepend a dot to the filename and sym-link into the home directory, but please take note of the following exceptions:

## Install

`install.sh` script shamelessly stolen from https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

## bash_profile

For Mac OS X 10.6, last time I checked.

## Xmodmap

To switch Capslock for CTRL; but not tested yet :(
